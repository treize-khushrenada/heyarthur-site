Since University, I have developed a strong interest in technology. Back then at school, together with my teammates, we were exploring ways to leverage technologies when it comes to content development and delivery. As a chairman representing our school online news outlet, we developed a short video platform as a way to present news, instead of via traditional text format. 

Upon graduation, I must credit my professional development in innovation management to my 3 years at Apple where I have developed a solid foundation in user interview skills and software workflow design. The best takeaway was the knowledge and skills required to communicate between users and products using Apple's unique philosophy in innovation process and consumer psychology.
