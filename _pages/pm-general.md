My expertise lies in my sharp instinct knowing how to build the right product, thanks to my intensive training in the challenging  startup environment for 5 years. I was able to get my hands on the full product development cycle, ranging from internal systems, B2B integrations, consumer-level apps, and practice a variety of frameworks and tools to optimize product development workflow and value proposition.

A variety of products is under my portfolio, including user- generated content platform (lifehack.org), online reservation systems (Travelflan), customers facing chatbots and related CMS (HSBC x LivePerson); working with cross-regional teams of developers and business stakeholders at scale. Along with product deliveries, I have managed the full spectrum of PM activities, from user requirements gathering, product vision and roadmapping, down to epics/ user story development, funnel optimization and continuous integrations tasks.

Selected work (product backlog and lower level documents could not be shared due to business confidentiality):
