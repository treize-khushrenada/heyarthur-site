I have also led to build a data insights system which integrates conversational data, e-commerce data and in-app data, which was a state of the art product in the industry.

With a strong passion in AI and as a former journalist, I have been looking for new challenges where I can work with talented people to solve big problems, specifically on improving content delivery and generation.
