I am an AI-enthusiast and product manager, certified Agile personnel and Apple alumn, with more than 10 years of experience in technology field.

I have led multiple teams across industries to innovate, grow and achieve business goals with big data/ AI technologies. More than 10 products were delivered, ranging from consumer apps to enterprise systems, impacting hundred of thousands of users and business stakeholders.

My AI product experience started in 2017, when I helped a 500 startup company to develop an AI solution, automating travel planning experience with integrated NLP and e-commerce technologies. That has led me to a management role at one of the largest finance institutions, overseeing their conversational AI roadmap and operations.

Amidst the recent accomplishments in AI research democratization in related technologies, I was intrigued by the gap between record-breaking state-of-the-art results and the user/ business satisfactions on the other end.

In 2021, I started my research and study journey at the University of Michigan, getting in touch with latest outlook, progress and challenges in AI. I also advanced my hands-on knowledge in data science, machine learning architectures, model development and evaluation, and the overall data pipeline.

I am committed to finding new ways that can unleash the power of AI, especially attributing to empowering self-expression, content generation, and quality education.

Let's enrich more lives by building the right tools for the people! Who's with me?
