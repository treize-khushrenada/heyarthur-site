title: "AI/ Data Science Research"
---
I have started research in applied AI and data science technologies, by taking a closer look to successes and failed cases, and deepen my understanding in data models/ pipelines.

Jul 2021 - now: Deep Learning Research Team at University of Michigan School of Information - [1Cademy](https://1cademy.com/)

Self-conducted studies/ research scope:
- Applications in pre-trained language models for conversation systems
- Machine learning architectures and pipelines development
- Data and algorithm transparency
- Domain problem/ data model fitting strategies
- Product analytics combined with advanced data science skills 

[Personal Statement in Data Scientist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RFOikLoy9FHzH5Oez7bbI7DqoPAjQU2XVwh6Y7uh7kM/edit?usp=sharing)

With solid data manipulation and machine learning techniques developed the applied data science master’s programme at the University of Michigan, I am able to understand to data scientists and researcher’s work, and to speak in their language, in order to drive success through pragmatic, effective product delivery, and manage customer expectations professionally.
