title: "AI/ Data Science Research"
---
I have started research in applied AI and data science technologies, by taking a closer look to successes and failed cases, and deepen my understanding in data models/ pipelines.

With solid data manipulation and machine learning techniques developed the applied data science master’s programme at the University of Michigan, I am able to understand to data scientists and researcher’s work, and to speak in their language, in order to drive success through pragmatic, effective product delivery, and manage customer expectations professionally.

Current Projects: 
1. Deep Learning Research Team at University of Michigan School of Information - [1Cademy](https://1cademy.com/)
2. Aug 2021: [Time Series Conversation Analysis](https://github.com/treize-khushrenada/Conversation-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Time-Series-Data/blob/main/code/ironhack_DA_slack_sentiment_mdoels.ipynb)

Self-conducted studies/ research scope:
- Applications in pre-trained language models for conversation systems
- Machine learning architectures and pipelines development
- Data and algorithm transparency
- Domain problem/ data model fitting strategies
- Product analytics combined with advanced data science skills
