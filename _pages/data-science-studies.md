title: "AI/ Data Science Research"
---
I have started research in applied AI and data science technologies, by taking a closer look to successes and failed cases, and deepen my understanding in data models/ pipelines.

With solid data manipulation and machine learning techniques developed the applied data science master’s programme at the University of Michigan, I am able to understand to data scientists and researcher’s work, and to speak in their language, in order to drive success through pragmatic, effective product delivery, and manage customer expectations professionally.
