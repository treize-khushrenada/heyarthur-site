I was certified by PMI as an Agile Certified Practitioner in 2019, formally recognizing my knowledge of agile principles and your skill with agile techniques. It spans many approaches to agile such as Scrum, Kanban, Lean, extreme programming (XP) and test-driven development (TDD). 

I have also led an initiative to build a data insights system which integrates conversational data, e-commerce data and in-app data, which was a state of the art product in the industry. Under my leadership, our team pioneered in applied AI technologies.


My expertise also lies in my sharp instinct knowing how to build the right product, thanks to my intensive training in the challenging  startup environment for 5 years. I was able to get my hands on the full product development cycle, ranging from internal systems, B2B integrations, consumer-level apps, and practice a variety of frameworks and tools to optimize product development workflow and value proposition.
