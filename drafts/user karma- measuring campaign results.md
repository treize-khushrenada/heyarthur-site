bottom to the top: knowing how to get value towards user understanding. when learning user retention cause (user do more x to cause higher retention), is single shot campaign a good way? probably not. because the campaign itself may also drive some motivateion to user retention


When we are calling for an action, we are driving users to buy something, or check out somthing. so we usually use the conversion rate to measure the magnitufe of us converting to do something. when we succeed, we celeberate. when the results are not the significant, we iterate again in the next time window, hopefully to avoid making the same mistakes. 

my question is: is that a fair and effective mechanism from a product management perspective?


when we look at the CTA campaigns, we usually assum the triggers are the causes, and the final user interaction (say a successful checkout or applying a coupon) as the outcome. but is that true? If we are to create an effective user portrait, we should really get to understand what motivate our users.

we can calculate the degree of associations between different triggers and the final outcomes, what are the unmeasured confounders? are there any? thats why coming up explicit and well documented assumptions is so crucial. or else we would just assume the campaign's success to be a good visual design, or the right slogan, or an attractive image, but 1) might not be true and 2) maybe not relevant to users mental models. 


another thing is about user retention study and promotional campaign. 
concepts to talk about- first stage, independence, exlusion restriction-> that is we have to assure the campaign has no direct effect on the app usage.
